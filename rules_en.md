# 📘 Borako Rules (Team Version) — English (with “2” clarified)

> This is an English translation of your group’s rules, written as a clear rulebook with examples.

## 1) Cards & Players
### 1.1 Deck
- Use **two standard decks** = **104 cards**, plus **two “Devil Joker” cards 🃏**.
- Suits (your naming):
  - ♣️ **Zahr** (Clubs)
  - ♦️ **Dinar** (Diamonds)
  - ♠️ **Sabat** (Spades)
  - ♥️ **Qalb** (Hearts)
- Because there are two decks, **every card exists twice**.

**Example**
- The card **7♥** appears **two times** in the combined decks.

### 1.2 Players & Teams
- **4 players** total.
- Two teams of **2 players** each.
- Winning target: **350 (team total)**.

### 1.3 Match scoring (your system)
- Each round produces “round points”.
- Convert round points into the team total by dividing by **10**:
  - **Team gain = (round points) ÷ 10**

**Example**
- If a team’s round points = **350**, then **350 ÷ 10 = 35** gets added to the team’s total.
- First team to reach **350** total wins.

---

## 2) Setup & Table Layout
### 2.1 Dealing
- Each player receives **11 cards**.
- Each team also gets a **Mour** pile = **11 face-down cards** reserved for that team.

### 2.2 Areas on the table
- A **Meld area** for Team A and Team B (where teams place their melds).
- A central **Discard pile** (cards thrown at end of turns).
- A face-down **Draw pile**.

**Example**
- Team A keeps their melds in one area; Team B keeps theirs separate.

---

## 3) Turn Structure (Draw OR Sweep)
### 3.1 One choice at the start of your turn ✅
At the start of your turn, you must choose **exactly one**:
1) **Draw**: take **one card** from the Draw pile, OR  
2) **Sweep (Takweesh)**: take the **entire Discard pile**.

> You cannot draw and sweep on the same turn ❌

**Example**
- If you sweep the discard pile, you do **not** draw from the draw pile this turn.

### 3.2 Sweep requirement ✅
If you sweep (take the discard pile), you must **immediately** do one of the following:
- **Open a new meld** for your team, OR
- **Add a card** to an existing meld of your team  
Then, at the end of your turn, you must discard **one** card.

**Example**
- You sweep → you add **8♥** to your team’s Hearts meld → then discard **4♦**.

### 3.3 End of turn
- Every turn ends with discarding **one card** to the Discard pile.

---

## 4) Melds (“Openings”) — Minimum & Types
### 4.1 Minimum size
- Minimum meld size is **3 cards**.

**Valid example**
- **5♥ 6♥ 7♥** (a 3-card run)

**Invalid example**
- **9♠ 10♠** (only 2 cards)

---

# 5) The “2” Card — IMPORTANT Clarification

## 5.1 Core rule
A **2** can be used in **two different ways**:
1) As a **normal “2”** (real value 2 inside the meld), OR  
2) As a **wild / substitute (Joker)** replacing a missing card in a meld.

> For scoring: if a 2 is used as a substitute, it counts as a **wild** for the 200/100 meld classification.
> If it is used as a normal 2, it does **not** count as a wild.

---

## 5.2 When is “2” a normal 2?
It is a normal 2 when it sits in its **natural position** in the run and matches the run’s suit.

**Example (normal 2)**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥**  
Here **2♥** is a normal 2 (not a substitute).

---

## 5.3 When is “2” a wild / substitute?
It becomes a substitute when it is used to replace a missing rank inside a run, and it may even come from a different suit.

**Example (2 used as a substitute)**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 2♦ 7♥ 8♥**  
This represents the Hearts run missing **6♥**, so **2♦** is used as the substitute for **6♥**.  
➡️ Therefore **2♦** is treated as a wild/substitute here.

---

# 6) Standard Run Melds (Same-Suit Runs)
## 6.1 Definition
A standard meld is a **consecutive run** in the **same suit**.

**Example**
- **9♣ 10♣ J♣**

---

## 6.2 How 200 / 100 works for runs (7+ cards)
### Rule
- If the run has **fewer than 7 cards**: no 100/200 bonus; only card values count.
- If the run has **7 or more cards**:
  - **200** if the run is **clean** (no wild/substitute used)
  - **100** if the run has **exactly one wild/substitute** (a 2-as-wild or a Devil Joker)
  - **No 200 and no 100** if the run contains **two wilds/substitutes**
- **Card values are always counted**, regardless of whether the 100/200 applies.

### Examples
**(A) 200 — clean run**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥**  
➡️ **200**

**(B) 100 — one substitute (your example)**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 2♦ 7♥ 8♥**  
➡️ **100** (because there is one substitute: 2♦)

**(C) No 200/100 — two substitutes**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 2♦ 7♥ 🃏**  
➡️ No 200/100 (two substitutes: 2♦ and 🃏)  
➡️ But card values still count.

---

## 6.3 “Substitute in the correct place” exception
If a **2** is present as a **normal 2** (not acting as a substitute), it does not increase the substitute count.

**Example**
- **2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 🃏**  
Here **2♥** is normal; only the Devil Joker 🃏 is a substitute.  
➡️ The run has **one** substitute → **100**.

---

# 7) Special Group Melds (Sets) — Allowed Only for A, 2, 3
## 7.1 Allowed sets ✅
You may open a “same-rank group” (a set) only for:
- **Aces (A)**
- **Twos (2)**
- **Threes (3)**

Any other rank set is **not allowed** ❌

**Valid examples**
- **A♥ A♠ A♦**
- **2♥ 2♠ 2♦**
- **3♥ 3♣ 3♦**

**Invalid example**
- **7♥ 7♠ 7♦** (not allowed)

---

## 7.2 Completed 7-card set values
If the set reaches **7 cards**:
- **Seven 3s** = **300**
- **Seven Aces** = **300**
- **Seven 2s** = **400**

**Example (Seven 2s)**
- **2♥ 2♥ 2♣ 2♣ 2♦ 2♦ 2♠**  
➡️ **400**

---

## 7.3 Wild impact on A / 3 / 2 sets
- Seven 3s + one wild (Joker) ➜ **150**
- Seven Aces + one wild (Joker) ➜ **150**
- Six 2s + a Devil Joker 🃏 ➜ **200**

**Examples**
- (3s) **six 3s + 🃏** ➜ **150**
- (Aces) **six Aces + 🃏** ➜ **150**
- (2s) **six 2s + 🃏** ➜ **200**

---

# 8) Mour Pile & Penalty
## 8.1 Taking the Mour
When a player empties their hand (hand becomes 0), their team takes the **Mour** pile (if not taken yet) and continues.

**Example**
- A Team A player plays their last card → Team A picks up their Mour (11 cards) and keeps playing.

## 8.2 Penalty for never taking Mour
If a round ends and a team **never took their Mour**:
- Subtract **100** from that team’s round points  
- Which equals **-10** after dividing by 10.

**Example**
- Team round points = 280  
- They never took Mour  
➡️ 280 − 100 = 180  
➡️ 180 ÷ 10 = **18** added to team total.

---

# 9) Card Value Table (for counting cards in melds & hands)
- **A** = 1.5  
- **2** = 1 (whether used as normal 2 or as a substitute)  
- **3 to 7** = 0.5  
- **8 to “old man” (8,9,10,J,Q,K)** = 1  

**Example**
- **A + 7 + K** = 1.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **3**

> Note: You did not define a numeric value for the Devil Joker 🃏 in the card-value table; the rules above use it mainly for meld classification and the special-set values (e.g., 6 twos + 🃏 = 200).

---

# 10) End-of-Round Scoring (Practical Summary)
1) Add meld bonuses (200/100/300/400/150/200, etc.).
2) Add the **values of the cards inside melds** (always counted).
3) Subtract the value of cards remaining in your team’s hands.
4) Apply the Mour penalty if needed (−100).
5) Divide by 10 and add to the team total.

**Quick example**
- Meld bonuses: 200 + 100  
- Card values inside melds: 50  
- Cards left in team hands: 20 (subtract)  
➡️ (200 + 100 + 50) − 20 = 330  
➡️ 330 ÷ 10 = **33** added to the team total.
